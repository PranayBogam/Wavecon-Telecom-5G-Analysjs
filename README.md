# Wavecon-Telecom-5G-Analysjs

I'm pleased to have contributed to a Wavecon Telecom initiative. Our goal is to examine how their 5G rollout affected key performance indicators (KPIs) and investigate how effective data-driven choices may be in promoting growth and recovery.


ðŸŒ¼ Quick Overview of Goals:

1 Discover the impact of the 5G introduction on revenue.

â¿¢ Determine which KPIâ€”revenue, ARPU, TAU, or TUsUâ€”is underperforming after the launch of 5G.

â¿£ After 5G is implemented, identify plans that are profitable and those that are not.

4. Determine whether any plans were significantly impacted by the introduction of 5G; if so, should they be continued or abandoned?

â¿¥ Examine ideas shelved after the introduction of 5G and the rationale behind the choices.


ðŸ“ˆ KPI Investigation:

This trip improved my understanding of key telecom KPIs, such as ARPU and TAU, which are critical for understanding industry trends.



ðŸ“Š Instruments utilized:

We used Zoom, Microsoft Clipchamp, Microsoft PowerPoint, Power BI, and other tools to create an engaging story using images and information.


The telecom sector lives on comprehending and utilizing data for a better consumer experienceâ€”it goes beyond simple connectivity. I've given Wavecon Telecom useful information to help them successfully navigate theÂ 5GÂ environment.
